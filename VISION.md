# 🦊 Foliofox - Vision

Foliofox started as a tool to replace my spreadsheet and because I needed someone to talk to about my financial decisions.  
I wanted a reviewer, a second opinion.

I used to ask ChatGPT or Claude things like:

- “_When will I reach X net worth considering my historical performance and contributions?_”
- “_I have X extra cash this month. Which position is currently in a drawdown I could add to?_”
- “_I want to save X by X date for a mortgage deposit. Can you analyze my portfolio and build me a plan?_”

At times, I ended up asking very bold questions, like whether I should buy or sell a specific stock, and in what quantity.

The problem was always the same: I had to provide too much context every time.

All of these questions only make sense if the AI has access not just to your current portfolio, but to your **full history** of savings, investments, earnings, and decisions over time.

So I started wondering: what if the AI already had all that context?

That question is why Foliofox exists.

## The Core Idea

Foliofox is built around a simple insight:  
**financial decisions are longitudinal**, but most tools (and AIs) treat them as isolated events.

Generic chatbots don’t work well for personal finance because they don’t remember you.  
They don’t know how you got here, what you’ve already tried, or what trade-offs you’ve made in the past.

Foliofox solves this by giving the AI direct, structured access to your portfolio, your history, and your goals. Conversations about money can be contextual, consistent, and actually useful.

## What Foliofox Is (and Is Not)

Today, Foliofox is a clean, simple portfolio tracker with a sprinkle of AI.

But the tracker is not the end goal: it’s the foundation.

Foliofox is **not**:

- a budgeting app
- an expense tracker
- a “how much did I spend on coffee today” tool
- a platform for beginners or daily traders

It’s built for people who already manage their own finances and want a **thinking partner**, not a lecture.

## Who It’s For

Foliofox is designed for financially literate users.

People from communities like:

- FIRE
- Bogleheads
- Personal Finance

Users who self-manage their portfolios, think long-term, and value clarity over noise.

These users don’t want hand-holding or gamification.  
They want an unbiased sparring partner to discuss plans, scenarios, and decisions with.

## The AI Advisor

The long-term vision for Foliofox is a personal AI financial assistant.

A smart, unbiased, and naturally cheaper advisor that knows your finances inside out.

The AI is not meant to replace human judgment: it’s meant to **augment it**.

That’s why the advisor has different modes:

- **Educational** — to explain concepts and reasoning
- **Advisory** — to suggest plans and trade-offs
- **Unhinged** — to challenge assumptions and provoke thinking

I strongly dislike the idea that “AI can’t give financial advice.”

People already use AI for therapy every day. Why not finance?

Our users are adults. They understand that AI can be wrong, just like any human advisor.  
It’s up to the user to evaluate, revise, follow, or ignore the advice.

## Direction

Right now, the priority is clear:  
**Foliofox must first be a rock-solid tracker.**

Clean, intuitive, pleasant to use.  
It does exactly what it says it does, and nothing more.

But the long-term direction is equally clear.

The tracker gives the AI context.  
The AI gives the tracker purpose.

## Monetization (Early Thoughts)

Foliofox was never built with monetization as the primary goal, but some principles are clear:

- The tracker should remain free and open source: Portfolio tracking is a commodity, not rocket science, and finance is a sensitive topic where trust matters.
- Positions and usage shouldn’t be artificially limited, users should feel at home.
- AI integrations can be paid, since they have real, ongoing costs.

Once users rely on Foliofox to understand and manage their portfolio, switching becomes hard.  
And once they experience a truly contextual AI advisor, that’s the moment Foliofox can genuinely wow them.
