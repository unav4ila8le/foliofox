# Foliofox

A modern net worth tracking app built with Next.js, Supabase, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Track net worth over time with interactive charts
- Multi-currency support with automatic exchange rates
- Secure authentication and user profiles
- Modular, type-safe codebase

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- PostgreSQL 17+ (for database schema operations)
- A Supabase project (get your Project URL and anon key)
- Optional: Vercel account (for one-click deploy and scheduled cron jobs)

### 1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unav4ila8le/foliofox.git
cd foliofox
npm install
```

### 2) Configure environment

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional (needed for scheduled jobs / admin tasks)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Optional (used to authorize cron invocations)
CRON_SECRET=generate_a_strong_random_string

# Optional (used for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional (used for domain valuations)
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token

# Optional (used for posthog)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=<ph_project_api_key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://<us | eu>.i.posthog.com
```

### 3) Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

### 4) Database Setup (Optional)

This repository includes a schema-only dump at `supabase/schema/schema.sql` so you can reproduce the database structure with zero data.

**Apply to your own Supabase project:**

```bash
npx supabase db execute \
  --db-url "postgresql://postgres:<password>@db.<your-ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres" \
  supabase/schema/schema.sql
```

**Apply locally (for local development):**

```bash
npx supabase start
npx supabase db reset
npx supabase db execute supabase/schema/schema.sql
```

**Regenerate schema (maintainers only):**

```bash
# Note: Requires PostgreSQL 17+ for version compatibility
pg_dump "postgresql://postgres.<your-project-ref>:<password>@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require" \
  --schema-only \
  --schema=public \
  --file=supabase/schema/schema.sql
```

**Notes:**

- This is structure-only (no data). App data is generated by the app.
- The dump includes DDL, RLS, indexes, and functions from the `public` schema.
- PostgreSQL 17+ is required for generating/importing the schema

### 5) (Optional) Generate database types from Supabase

If you use your own Supabase project, regenerate `types/database.types.ts`:

```bash
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
# Option A: use the provided script (update project id in package.json first)
npm run types:supabase
# Option B: ad-hoc generation
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-ref> > types/database.types.ts
```

### 6) (Optional) Deploying to Vercel

- Import the repo into Vercel
- Set the same environment variables in Vercel (Project Settings → Environment Variables)
- This repo includes `vercel.json` with daily cron jobs at 22:00 UTC for quotes and FX updates. The cron endpoints expect an `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` header. If supported in your Vercel plan, you can add headers directly in `vercel.json` like this:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/fetch-exchange-rates",
      "schedule": "0 22 * * *",
      "headers": { "authorization": "Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}" }
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/fetch-quotes",
      "schedule": "0 22 * * *",
      "headers": { "authorization": "Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}" }
    }
  ]
}
```

If headers cannot be configured in your environment, you can trigger the endpoints manually (see below) or adjust your deployment to inject the header.

### 7) Manually trigger cron jobs (local/testing)

```bash
# Exchange rates
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/fetch-exchange-rates" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"

# Quotes
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/fetch-quotes" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

## Package Dependencies Notes

- [x] Allow users to export their positions
- [x] Change primary button in navbar to "New" with dropdown
- [x] Change order of new position fields

- [x] Add news based on user's portfolio
- [x] Add domains tracking support
- [x] Replace `quoteDate` with `asOfDate` across positions APIs
- [x] Add `asOfDate` behavior: market-backed positions (symbols/domains) use market data as-of with record fallback; basic positions use latest record ≤ date
- [x] Centralize market data in `server/market-data/fetch.ts` with include flags:
  - `marketPrices` (quotes + domain valuations, defaults ON)
  - `exchangeRates` (FX, defaults ON)
  - Pass `{ include: { marketPrices: false } }` for FX-only scenarios
- [x] Optimize projected income analysis
- [x] Improve folder structure for mappings in lib
- [x] Prevent user from creating positions with same name
