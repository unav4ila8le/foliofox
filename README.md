## Utility Functions Cheatsheet

### Number Formatting

The project includes several utility functions for number formatting. Here's a quick cheatsheet:

```typescript
// Basic number formatting
formatNumber(1234.5678); // "1,235"
formatNumber(1234.5678, 2); // "1,234.57"

// Currency formatting (uses currency-specific decimal places)
formatCurrency(1234.56, "USD"); // "USD 1,234.56"  // 2 decimals for USD
formatCurrency(1234.56, "JPY"); // "JPY 1,235"     // 0 decimals for JPY
formatCurrency(1234.56, "BHD"); // "BHD 1,234.560" // 3 decimals for BHD
formatCurrency(1234.56, "USD", { display: "symbol" }); // "$1,234.56"
formatCurrency(1234.56, "JPY", { display: "symbol" }); // "Â¥1,235"

// Percentage formatting
formatPercentage(0.1234); // "12.34%"
formatPercentage(0.1234, 1); // "12.3%"

// Compact number formatting
formatCompactNumber(1234567); // "1.2M"
formatCompactCurrency(1234567, "USD"); // "1.2M USD"
```

All formatting functions accept both numbers and strings as input. Currency formatting automatically uses the appropriate number of decimal places based on the currency code. For more details, check the implementation in `lib/number/format.ts`.

## To Do List

[x] Add percentages increase over the different time periods selected
[x] Add financial data API to allow users to add fianncial instruments like stocks and other equities ( https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2 )
[ ] Use client for exchange rates, symbols and quotes (they are not private data)
[x] Add disclaimer about the fact that exchange rates and market prices are not updated in real-time but rather updated daily (10PM UTC)
[ ] Allow users to import CSV files
[ ] Allow users to export their holdings
[x] Change primary button in navbar to "New" with dropdown
[x] Change order of new holding fields
[x] Dynamic quantity fields
[x] Holding current value should be the latest quote if holding has a symbol_id
[x] Prevent users from adding a symbol with a currency not in the database (currency not supported yet)
[ ] Find a way to have a more accurate historical calculation which doesn't add much overhead. WeeksBack solution is fast but not accurate cause the date is "rounded" to match weeks and not days.
[x] Add P/L in the holdings table (basic change from first record, no cost basis)
[x] Start migrating to the new JWT signing key https://supabase.com/blog/jwt-signing-keys
[ ] Add a dividends tracker. It should show the user the holdings that pay dividends, and their yearly/monthly expected dividend payout
