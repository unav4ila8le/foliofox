## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- PostgreSQL 17+ (for database schema operations)
- A Supabase project (get your Project URL, anon/publishable key, service_role/secret key)
- Optional: Vercel account (for one-click deploy and scheduled cron jobs)

### 1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unav4ila8le/foliofox.git
cd foliofox
npm install
```

### 2) Configure environment

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_or_publishable_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_or_secret_key

# Optional (used to authorize cron invocations)
CRON_SECRET=generate_a_strong_random_string

# Optional (used for AI features)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Optional (used for domain valuations)
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token

# Optional (used for PostHog)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=<ph_project_api_key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://<us | eu>.i.posthog.com
```

### 3) Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000

### 4) Database setup

This repository includes a schema-only dump at `supabase/schema/schema.sql` so you can reproduce the database structure with zero data.

**Apply to your own Supabase project:**

```bash
npx supabase db execute \
  --db-url "postgresql://postgres:<password>@db.<your-ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres" \
  supabase/schema/schema.sql
```

**Apply locally with the Supabase CLI:**

```bash
npx supabase start
npx supabase db reset
npx supabase db execute supabase/schema/schema.sql
```

**Regenerate schema dump (maintainers only):**

```bash
# Note: Requires PostgreSQL 17+ for version compatibility
pg_dump "postgresql://postgres.<your-project-ref>:<password>@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require" \
  --schema-only \
  --schema=public \
  --file=supabase/schema/schema.sql
```

**Notes:**

- This is structure-only (no data). App data is generated by the app.
- The dump includes DDL, RLS, indexes, and functions from the `public` schema.
- PostgreSQL 17+ is required for generating/importing the schema

### 5) (Optional) Generate TypeScript types from Supabase

If you use your own Supabase project, regenerate `types/database.types.ts`:

```bash
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
# Option A: use the provided script (update project id in package.json first)
npm run types:supabase
# Option B: ad-hoc generation
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-project-ref> > types/database.types.ts
```

### 6) (Optional) Deploy to Vercel

- Import the repo into Vercel.
- Set the same environment variables (Project Settings → Environment Variables).
- `vercel.json` includes daily cron jobs at 22:00 UTC for quotes and FX updates.
- Cron endpoints expect `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`.

If headers can’t be configured in your environment, trigger manually:

```bash
# Exchange rates
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/fetch-exchange-rates" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"

# Quotes
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/fetch-quotes" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

### Package dependencies notes

N/A

## Types

We use strict TypeScript for type safety. Some rules to follow:

- Never use `any` type. Implicit or explicit.
- Prefer `unknown` over `any`. Refine the type.
- Always type your function parameters and return values explicitly; do not rely on implicit any or inference.
- Do not use `as` type assertions. The only exception is `as const`.

## Linting & Formatting

Our linter will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code.

- Check lint status: `npm run lint`
- Check formatting: `npm run format`

## Commit Message Convention

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/): `type(scope): summary`

- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`
- Scope: folder or domain, e.g. `server/positions`, `app/dashboard`, `ai`

Examples:

```text
feat(positions): add cost basis override to new position form
fix(exchange-rates): handle missing base currency fallback
docs(contributing): document commit conventions and pr checklist
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused; one change per PR.
- Title should follow Conventional Commits if possible.
- Link related issues: Closes #123.
- Describe what/why; include screenshots for UI changes.
- Tests if applicable; no lint/type errors; run locally.
- Follow project rules (RSC-first, TypeScript strict, server actions in server/, import order, naming).
- Avoid breaking changes; if unavoidable, document migration in the PR.
- For features, note performance, accessibility, and data model impacts.

## Reporting Bugs

First search existing [issues](https://github.com/unav4ila8le/foliofox/issues). If nothing matches, open a new [issue](https://github.com/unav4ila8le/foliofox/issues/new).

- Ensure you’re on the latest version of `development`
- Provide clear expected vs actual behavior
- Include steps to reproduce (ideally a minimal example and screenshots/screen recodings if they apply). If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, I will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- Add environment details (OS, Node, package manager)
- **Security issues:** [report a vulnerability](https://github.com/unav4ila8le/foliofox/security) (do not post security issues publicly)

## Suggesting Enhancements

- Search existing [issues](https://github.com/unav4ila8le/foliofox/issues)
- Explain current vs desired behavior and why it helps most users
- Include alternatives considered and, if helpful, screenshots or references
