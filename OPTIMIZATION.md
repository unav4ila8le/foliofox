# üöÄ Patrivio Performance Optimization Plan

## üìä Current Performance Analysis

### **Performance Bottlenecks Identified:**

1. **‚ùå Major N+1 Query Problems:**

   - `fetchHoldings()` - makes separate DB query for each holding's latest record
   - `calculateNetWorth()` - sequential processing of holdings with multiple API calls per holding
   - `calculateAssetAllocation()` - multiple exchange rate fetches

2. **‚ùå Inefficient Sequential Processing:**

   - Net worth calculation processes holdings one by one (should be parallel)
   - Multiple API calls to Yahoo Finance and exchange rates
   - Redundant database connections in server actions

3. **‚ùå Missing Caching:**

   - No caching for expensive net worth calculations (already noted in README TODO)
   - Exchange rates and quotes fetched individually
   - No memoization for repeated calculations

4. **‚ùå Excessive Client Components:**
   - Many components that could be server-side are marked as "use client"
   - Breadcrumb component fetches data client-side unnecessarily
