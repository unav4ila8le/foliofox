# üöÄ Patrivio Performance Optimization Plan

## üìä Current Performance Analysis

### **Performance Bottlenecks Identified:**

1. **‚ùå Major N+1 Query Problems:**
   - `fetchHoldings()` - makes separate DB query for each holding's latest record
   - `calculateNetWorth()` - sequential processing of holdings with multiple API calls per holding
   - `calculateAssetAllocation()` - multiple exchange rate fetches

2. **‚ùå Inefficient Sequential Processing:**
   - Net worth calculation processes holdings one by one (should be parallel)
   - Multiple API calls to Yahoo Finance and exchange rates
   - Redundant database connections in server actions

3. **‚ùå Missing Caching:**
   - No caching for expensive net worth calculations (already noted in README TODO)
   - Exchange rates and quotes fetched individually
   - No memoization for repeated calculations

4. **‚úÖ Client Components Architecture:**
   - ‚úÖ **Resolved**: Most client components are appropriately client-side
   - ‚úÖ **Decision**: `greetings.tsx` stays client-side (needs user timezone)
   - ‚úÖ **Decision**: Data fetchers like `useCurrencies` stay client-side (faster UX, public data)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remaining**: Breadcrumb component could potentially be optimized
