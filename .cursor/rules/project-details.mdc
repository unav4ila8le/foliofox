# Patrivio - MVP Requirements

## 1. Project Overview
I am building a **minimalist net worth tracking web app** to replace my current Google Sheet system. This app should automate manual processes, improve usability, and provide simple visualizations. 

Unlike apps like Mint or Getquin, **this app will not require bank or broker integrations** for the moment. Instead, it will provide an intuitive interface for manually entering and updating financial data. It needs to feel safe, solid and trustworthy.

This project is built for myself as the primary user, with the potential for future expansion if there is market interest.

## 2. Competitors
I have drafted a short list of other products that are doing something very similar to what I am trying to do. You should use them as reference for best practice for handling the data, data structure, user experience and interface.

- https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe (open source, you can actually look at the code) (best for user experience and interface)
- https://www.getquin.com/ (good for user experience and interface)
- https://www.kubera.com/
- https://www.fireleap.com/
- https://www.portfolio-performance.info/
