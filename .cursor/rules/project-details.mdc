# Patrivio - MVP Requirements

## 1. Project Overview
I am building a **minimalist net worth tracking web app** to replace my current Google Sheet system. This app should automate manual processes, improve usability, and provide simple visualizations. 

Unlike apps like Mint or Getquin, **this app will not require bank or broker integrations** for the moment. Instead, it will provide an intuitive interface for manually entering and updating financial data. It needs to feel safe, solid and trustworthy.

This project is built for myself as the primary user, with the potential for future expansion if there is market interest.
