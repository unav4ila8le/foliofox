# Patrivio - MVP Requirements

## 1. Project Overview
I am building a **net worth tracking web app** to replace my current Google Sheet system. This app should automate manual processes, improve usability, and provide clear visualizations. 

Unlike apps like Mint or Getquin, **this app will not require bank or broker integrations** for the moment. Instead, it will provide an intuitive interface for manually entering and updating financial data. It needs to feel safe, solid and trustworthy.

This project is built for myself as the primary user, with the potential for future expansion if there is market interest.

## 2. Competitors
I have drafted a short list of other products that are doing something very similar to what I am trying to do. You should use them as reference for best practice for handling the data, data structure, user experience and interface.

- https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe (open source, you can actually look at the code) (best for user experience and interface)
- https://www.getquin.com/ (good for user experience and interface)
- https://www.kubera.com/
- https://www.fireleap.com/
- https://www.portfolio-performance.info/

## 3. Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn
- Language: TypeScript
- Database: Supabase
- Hosting: Vercel
- Codebase management: GitHub
- Financial Data API: TBD

## 4. Core Features (MVP Scope)
### Transactions-Based Net Worth Tracking
The app uses a hybrid approach to track net worth:

1. **Balance-Based Tracking (for Cash/Bank Accounts)**
- Users update account balances periodically (weekly/monthly)
- No need to track individual expenses
- Historical balance snapshots are stored
- Changes between periods are automatically calculated

2. **Transaction-Based Tracking (for Investments)**
Users log investment activities through transactions:
- Investment Purchase (Buying stocks, real estate, crypto, etc.)
- Investment Sale (Selling stocks, withdrawing funds, crypto, etc.)
- Asset Transfer (Moving money between investment accounts)
Each transaction updates the related investment category and maintains historical accuracy.

Support for editing and deleting past transactions/balances with proper adjustments to calculations.
Transfer transactions should link outgoing and incoming entries to prevent double-counting.
Well structured category system for both assets and expenses to enable better analysis

### Data Input & Asset Selection
Users can quickly add transactions via a structured flow:
1. Select transaction type → Purchase, Sale, or Transfer
2. Choose category → Stock, Crypto, Real Estate, Credit Card, Cash, Metal, Luxury, etc.
3. Enter the transaction date
4. Specify source of funds. Users selecting stocks or crypto should be able to search for the specific asset and link a logo (similar to brokerage apps). The app dynamically calculates net worth based on transactions instead of static snapshots
5. Enter amount and quantity for investment assets
6. Add a short description (optional)

(For later) Support for bulk import of historical data from CSV/Excel (Google Sheets export).

### Automated Historical Data Storage
- The system fetches closing prices for assets once per day
- Historical asset prices are snapshotted daily and stored in the database, ensuring that past data can be retrieved without frequent API calls
- Users can view historical performance over time using stored data rather than making repeated API requests
- Fallback mechanism for manual price updates when API fails or for non-standard assets
- Caching strategy to prioritize critical assets when approaching API limits

### Simple Currency Conversion
- A currency switch dropdown on the homepage allows users to view their final net worth in different currencies
- Only the aggregated net worth total is converted to the selected currency
- Individual assets and transactions remain in their original currency
- The system uses daily exchange rates to perform the conversion

### Asset Categories and Currency Handling

The system organizes assets into distinct categories, each with specific currency and valuation requirements:

1. **Cash & Bank Accounts**
   - Always requires specific currency (EUR, USD, etc.)
   - Types: Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts, Cash/Wallet, Credit Lines
   - Balance-based tracking with periodic updates
   - Direct currency conversion possible

2. **Investment Securities**
   - Usually traded in a specific market currency
   - Types: Stocks, ETFs, Bonds, Investment Funds
   - Transaction-based tracking
   - Requires price history in trading currency

3. **Cryptocurrencies**
   - Has native denomination (BTC, ETH, etc.)
   - Valued in user's preferred fiat currency
   - Transaction-based tracking
   - Requires price history in multiple fiat currencies

4. **Real Estate**
   - Valued in local currency where property is located
   - Types: Residential, Commercial, Land
   - Manual value updates with optional transaction history
   - May require currency conversion for total net worth

5. **Precious Metals**
   - Measured in weight (g, oz, kg)
   - Typically valued in USD (international standard)
   - Transaction-based tracking with weight and price
   - Requires spot price history

6. **Luxury Assets**
   - Valued in purchase/market currency
   - Types: Art, Collectibles, Watches, Other Valuables
   - Manual value updates with optional transaction history
   - May require periodic revaluation

### Currency Handling Rules
1. Each asset category has specific currency requirements:
   - Cash accounts: Must specify currency
   - Investment securities: Track in trading currency
   - Crypto: Track quantity in native units, value in fiat
   - Real estate: Track in local currency
   - Precious metals: Track weight and USD value
   - Luxury items: Track in purchase currency

2. Net Worth Calculation:
   - All assets are converted to user's preferred currency for total net worth
   - Use daily exchange rates for currency conversion
   - Store historical exchange rates for accurate point-in-time valuation

3. Transaction Requirements:
   - Purchase/Sale: Requires asset currency and transaction currency
   - Transfers: Must be in same currency or specify exchange rate
   - Updates: Must specify currency for value updates

## 8. General Instructions
Do NOT focus on UI styling. Keep layouts minimal, modular and easily scalable. I will handle the design. **In most cases I have already built the layout for you with placeholder/mock data**, please always check if that's the case and build logic and code to fit the UI.

The following are some general instructions. Please find detailed rules [global-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/global-rules.mdc)

- Build a prototype database first to validate the transaction model and calculations.
- Ensure clean and modular code. Split into reusable components.
- Use Next.js API routes to interact with Supabase.
- Transactions should update net worth dynamically instead of using static snapshots.
- Implement a clear caching strategy for API calls to financial data services.
- Charts should reflect transactions over time rather than just static numbers.
- Store daily closing prices for assets instead of fetching real-time historical data frequently.
- Create a data validation layer to prevent illogical transactions (negative balances, etc.).
- For transfers between accounts, link transactions to prevent double-counting in net worth.
- Implement materialized views or caching for performance as transaction history grows.
- Follow best practices for performance and scalability.
