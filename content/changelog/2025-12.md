## Scenario Planning (Beta)

![Scenario Planning](/images/changelog/2025-12/scenario-planning.jpg)

This month we shipped the first version of **Scenario Planning**.

- You can now explore **“what if” scenarios** based on your current net worth and contributions.
- It’s an early beta, but it already lets you reason about different financial paths instead of just tracking the past.

There’s a lot more coming here: better assumptions, configurable average yields, and more realistic long-term projections. This feature is very much in progress, and your feedback will directly shape it.

This feature was made possible thanks to [@effe-megna](https://github.com/effe-megna)'s continuous contribution.

## Bulk Records Import

Import is no longer limited to positions. You can now bulk import your records.

- Import multiple records at once. This makes it much faster to **backfill your net worth history** or migrate from spreadsheets.
- **Improved feedback during import**, making it clearer what was added and what failed, instead of silently skipping records.

Kudos to [@gionn](https://github.com/gionn) for his help in releasing this feature and supporting Foliofox's Developer Experience.

## AI Advisor Improvements

The AI advisor continues to mature behind the scenes.

- Improved internal tooling and structure allow the advisor to reason more consistently about your portfolio and history.
- Responses are more reliable, and this lays the groundwork for much deeper analysis in the future.

**We’re working every day to make the AI advisor better.**

## 💶 More Robust Exchange Rates

We added **better fallbacks for exchange rates**, making valuations more resilient when data providers fail or lag.
This improves accuracy, especially for users with international portfolios.

In December **we also added support for a new currency: AED**. You are now able to add securities listed in the Abu Dhabi and Dubai exchanges.

Feel free to reply to this email if your currency and/or a security you are looking for is not listed on Foliofox.
