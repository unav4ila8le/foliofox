## Daily Net Worth Tracking

A complete upgrade of how Foliofox tracks your net worth.

- Your chart now uses **daily data points** instead of weekly snapshots.
- This gives you way **more accurate history**, especially if your assets change often.
- The chart loads **much faster** thanks to a backend + caching optimization.

## Shareable Portfolio Links (Public Sharing)

Stop taking screenshots or photos of your screen (iykyk). Share your portfolio the clean way.

- You can now **enable public sharing** directly from your dashboard.
- Foliofox generates a **unique link** with an expiration date, perfect for Reddit posts, forums, or showing a friend.
- You can **edit the expiration, disable the link, or even customize your link name** (first come, first served).
- No personal info is included.

## A Smarter AI Advisor

The AI advisor now knows you better.

- There’s a new **Financial Profile** section in your menu where you can add context about your income, goals, experience, and risk tolerance.
- The AI Advisor uses this to give you **far more personalized guidance**.
- You’ll also **see exactly which tools the AI uses** to analyze your portfolio and history.

**We are working on making the AI advisor better everyday.**

## 🐳 Docker Support

For the more technical crowd: Foliofox now has full Docker support.

If you want to self-host Foliofox, spin it up locally, or run it on your own server, you can now do it with a single Docker setup.
