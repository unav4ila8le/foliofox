## Ticker Symbol Health Monitoring

Market data isn’t always reliable. Now Foliofox actively watches for issues.

- Foliofox now continuously **checks the health of the ticker symbols you own**, based on how fresh and reliable the price data is.
- If a symbol stops updating, becomes stale, or shows anomalies, **the issue is surfaced directly to you as a warning**.
- This can happen for several reasons: halted trading, data provider issues, or most commonly: **ticker symbol renames**.

When an issue is detected:

- You can now **change the ticker symbol of a position** while keeping your full history and net worth intact.

This is an important step toward making Foliofox a resilient tool.

## Extended Net Worth Chart Timeframes

More history, more perspective.

- You can now explore your net worth across **longer timeframes**, making it easier to focus on trends instead of short-term noise.
- Performance has been improved at the same time, so charts stay fast even as your data grows.

This builds on daily net worth tracking and prepares the ground for more advanced analysis.

## Full Localization (Numbers, Dates, Currencies)

Foliofox now adapts to how you read numbers.

- Numbers, currencies, and dates are now fully localized based on your region.
- No more odd separators or mixed formats.

Language support will come later, this update lays the foundation.

## Portfolio Records with Advanced Sorting and Filtering

Your Portfolio Records finally got the space they deserve.

- We introduced a **dedicated Records page** with full sorting and filtering.
- You can slice your history by type, date, and other attributes.
- This makes audits, backfills, and cleanup much easier.

If you actively and manually manage your data, this one’s a big upgrade.
